# NCERTTBDL
Utility to download NCERT textbooks, but better.

# Development Process
The idea for this project was provided by Revant. He made the original CLI application and Zion modified it and converted it into a TKinter application. This entire process took only 2 days.

# The Future
We plan to expand upon the textbook library by adding all the grades in the CBSE ciricculum. By the time the textbooks change, we will have found a method to automate the process of updating it.
